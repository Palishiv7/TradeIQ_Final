# TradeIQ Assessment System Architecture

## Overview

TradeIQ is an AI-powered platform revolutionizing financial market education through dynamic, adaptive assessments. The system's architecture follows domain-driven design principles with a modular, layered approach that ensures separation of concerns, maintainability, and extensibility.

The assessment system serves as the core engine of the platform, providing infrastructure for generating questions, evaluating user answers, tracking performance, and adapting difficulty based on user skills. It's designed to support multiple assessment types (candlestick patterns, market fundamentals, and market psychology) within a unified framework.

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the assessment system's base architecture, detailing each component, their interactions, and the design patterns employed.

## Core Architectural Components

The assessment system is built around five primary components:

1. **Models**: Define the data structures and business entities
2. **Repositories**: Provide data access and persistence
3. **Services**: Implement core business logic
4. **Controllers**: Expose API endpoints and handle requests
5. **Tasks**: Execute background operations

Each component is designed with clear interfaces and abstractions, allowing for type-safe, maintainable code with proper dependency injection.

## Base Models (models.py)

The models module defines the core domain entities used throughout the assessment system.

### Key Enums

#### `AssessmentType`
```python
class AssessmentType(enum.Enum):
    """Types of assessment supported by the system."""
    CANDLESTICK = "candlestick"
    MARKET_FUNDAMENTAL = "market_fundamental"
    MARKET_PSYCHOLOGY = "market_psychology"
    TECHNICAL_ANALYSIS = "technical_analysis"
    RISK_MANAGEMENT = "risk_management"
```

#### `QuestionDifficulty`
```python
class QuestionDifficulty(enum.Enum):
    """Difficulty levels for assessment questions."""
    VERY_EASY = "very_easy"
    EASY = "easy"
    MEDIUM = "medium"
    HARD = "hard"
    VERY_HARD = "very_hard"
    
    @classmethod
    def from_numeric(cls, value: int) -> 'QuestionDifficulty':
        """Convert a numeric value (1-5) to a difficulty level."""
        # Implementation...
```

#### `SessionStatus`
```python
class SessionStatus(enum.Enum):
    """Status of an assessment session."""
    CREATED = "created"

## Assessment System Flow

The assessment system follows a well-defined flow of operations:

1. **Session Creation**:
   - User initiates an assessment
   - `AssessmentService.create_session()` creates a new session
   - `create_assessment_session` task generates questions asynchronously
   - Session with questions is returned to the user

2. **Question Presentation**:
   - User receives a question from the session
   - `AssessmentService.get_question()` retrieves question details
   - Question is presented with appropriate rendering (e.g., charts for candlestick patterns)

3. **Answer Submission**:
   - User submits an answer
   - `AssessmentService.submit_answer()` processes the answer
   - `evaluate_user_answer` task evaluates the answer asynchronously
   - Evaluation result is returned to the user
   - `update_user_performance` task updates metrics asynchronously

4. **Session Navigation**:
   - User navigates to next/previous questions
   - `AssessmentSession.next_question()` or `previous_question()` updates position
   - New question is presented to the user

5. **Session Completion**:
   - User completes all questions or ends the session
   - `AssessmentService.complete_session()` finalizes the session
   - `complete_assessment_session` task processes results asynchronously
   - `generate_session_summary` task creates a report asynchronously
   - Results and performance metrics are presented to the user

6. **Performance Analysis**:
   - User views performance metrics
   - `PerformanceAnalyzer.get_user_performance()` retrieves metrics
   - Metrics are presented with visualizations and recommendations

## Design Patterns and Principles

The assessment system employs several design patterns and principles:

### 1. Repository Pattern
- Separates data access logic from business logic
- Provides a collection-like interface for domain objects
- Enables easy substitution of data sources (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, in-memory)

### 2. Service Layer Pattern
- Defines application's boundary with a set of operations
- Coordinates the application's response to each operation
- Encapsulates domain logic and orchestrates repositories

### 3. Domain Model Pattern
- Places business logic primarily in domain objects (entities, value objects)
- Rich domain models with behavior, not just data containers
- Enforces invariants and business rules

### 4. Abstract Factory Pattern
- Provides interfaces for creating families of related objects
- Concrete implementations create specific object types
- Enables consistent creation of compatible objects

### 5. Strategy Pattern
- Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable
- Used for question generation, answer evaluation, and difficulty adaptation
- Allows for dynamic selection of strategies based on context

### 6. Observer Pattern
- Implements event-based communication between components
- Used for performance tracking and metrics updates
- Enables loose coupling between interdependent components

### 7. Command Pattern
- Encapsulates requests as objects with all necessary information
- Used in the tasks module for background processing
- Supports operations like retrying, queueing, and scheduling

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Classes are open for extension but closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes can be used in place of their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on methods they use
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules depend on abstractions

## Extending the Assessment System

The assessment system is designed for extension through inheritance and composition. To implement a specific assessment type like candlestick pattern recognition:

1. Define concrete question types extending `BaseQuestion`:
   ```python
   class CandlestickPatternQuestion(BaseQuestion):
       chart_data: List[Dict[str, Any]]
       pattern_type: str
       pattern_location: Optional[List[int]] = None
       
       def get_correct_answer(self) -> str:
           return self.metadata.get("correct_pattern")
       
       def evaluate_answer(self, user_answer: str) -> AnswerEvaluation:
           # Implementation...
   ```

2. Implement concrete repositories for data access:
   ```python
   class CandlestickQuestionRepository(QuestionRepository[CandlestickPatternQuestion]):
       # Implementation...
   
   class CandlestickSessionRepository(SessionRepository[CandlestickPatternSession]):
       # Implementation...
   ```

3. Implement concrete services for business logic:
   ```python
   class CandlestickPatternGenerator(QuestionGenerator[CandlestickPatternQuestion]):
       # Implementation...
   
   class CandlestickAnswerEvaluator(AnswerEvaluator[CandlestickPatternQuestion, AnswerEvaluation]):
       # Implementation...
   ```

4. Implement controllers for API access:
   ```python
   class CandlestickAssessmentController(BaseAssessmentController[CandlestickPatternQuestion, AssessmentSession]):
       # Implementation...
   ```

## Best Practices for Implementation

When implementing assessment components, follow these best practices:

1. **Type Safety**:
   - Use generic type parameters consistently
   - Leverage Python's typing module for static type checking
   - Define clear interfaces with proper type annotations

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Use specific exception types for different error cases
   - Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
   - Provide detailed error messages for debugging

3. **Asynchronous Programming**:
   - Use async/await for I/O-bound operations
   - Avoid blocking the event loop with CPU-intensive tasks
   - Implement proper cancellation and timeout handling

4. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for individual components
   - Create integration tests for component interactions
   - Use mocks and stubs for external dependencies

5. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement caching for expensive operations
   - Use database optimization techniques (indexing, pagination)
   - Offload heavy processing to background tasks

6. **Maintainability**:
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Document public APIs and complex logic
   - Keep methods focused and cohesive
