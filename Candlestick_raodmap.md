Candlestick Pattern Assessment System: Complete Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Foundation and Architecture Setup
Step 1: Define Common Architecture and Folder Structure
Modular Design:

Create a common module for shared utilities (logging, error handling, caching, and database connectivity).

Implement an abstract BaseAssessment class in common/assessment_base.py with standard methods:

generate_question()

evaluate_answer()

get_feedback()

Use OOP best practices to ensure code reusability and maintainability.

Folder Structure:

Record user responses to avoid duplicate questions.

Redis:

Cache recent questions and user session data to minimize database load.

Data Preparation:

Pre-fetch and store market data and AI-generated candlestick patterns in the database.

Use a background scheduler (Celery/Redis Queue) to update and refresh the dataset periodically.

Step 4: Market Data Integration (Database-First Approach)
Data Provider Service:

Fetch external market data periodically (respecting API limits) and store in PostgreSQL.

Normalize and validate the data for consistency.

Implement a caching layer to serve this data without excessive API calls.

Redundancy:

Integrate primary and fallback data sources to ensure reliability.

Phase 3: Advanced Pattern Detection and AI Integration
Step 5: Multi-Strategy Pattern Detection
Pattern Detection Interface:

Define a PatternDetector interface for candlestick pattern recognition.

Ensemble Approach:

Combine multiple detection strategies with a weighted consensus algorithm.

Implement automated fallback mechanisms if one method fails.

Pattern Taxonomy:

Define classification for single, double, and triple candlestick patterns (e.g., Doji, Hammer, Engulfing, Morning Star).

Confidence Scoring:

Develop a scoring system that uses model confidence and statistical validation to ensure accuracy.

Step 6: AI-Based Answer Evaluation and Explanation Generation
Answer Evaluation Pipeline:

Use the integrated AI model to evaluate user responses against the correct candlestick pattern.

Apply multi-tier validation with confidence thresholds.

Explanation Generation:

Generate detailed explanations for both correct and incorrect answers.

Use a combination of predefined templates and dynamic, AI-generated content.

Incorporate historical market examples and visual annotations for clarity.

Phase 4: Adaptive Difficulty and Question Generation
Step 7: Dynamic Question Generation
Question Template Database:

Create a repository of 50+ question templates categorized by difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

Selection Algorithm:

Implement logic (using a Bloom Filter or Count-Min Sketch) to avoid repetition and ensure unique questions.

Adjust the selection based on user history stored in the database.

Adaptive Mechanism:

The system adjusts question difficulty based on user performance metrics (accuracy, response time, streaks).

Use reinforcement learning or bandit algorithms to tune difficulty dynamically.

Step 8: Adaptive Difficulty Engine
User Profiling:

Track individual performance through the attempts table.

Calculate a learning rate and apply a forgetting curve model.

Dynamic Adjustment:

Increase difficulty when users consistently answer correctly.

Decrease difficulty after multiple incorrect answers.

Factor in response time for bonus XP and further difficulty modulation.

Phase 5: Gamification and Engagement Features
Step 9: Core Gamification System
XP and Leveling:

Design an XP system that awards points based on question difficulty, accuracy, and speed.

Implement leveling mechanics and bonus XP for streaks.

Achievements and Badges:

Create a framework for 30+ unique achievements with rarity tiers.

Implement hidden achievements to encourage exploration.

Leaderboards:

Develop assessment-specific leaderboards and a combined leaderboard that aggregates XP from all assessments.

Use Redis to cache leaderboard data for real-time display.

Step 10: Enhanced Engagement Features
AI-Powered Hints:

Allow users to request hints, with adaptive hint levels based on their performance.

Daily Challenges & Tournaments:

Implement time-bound challenges with bonus rewards.
