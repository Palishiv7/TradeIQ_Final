   - Input validation and error handling
   - Route registration and documentation

2. **Business Logic Layer**: Services and use cases
   - Implements core business logic
   - Coordinates between repositories and external services
   - Enforces business rules and validation

3. **Data Access Layer**: Repositories and data models
   - Abstracts database operations
   - Provides CRUD operations for entities
   - Ensures data consistency and integrity

4. **Common Infrastructure**: Shared components and utilities
   - Authentication and authorization
   - Caching and task scheduling
   - Logging and configuration

## Refactoring Plan

During architecture review, significant redundancy was identified between `backend/common/base_assessment.py` and `backend/assessments/base/` directory. These need consolidation for better maintainability:

### 1. Architecture Refactoring

**Current Issues:**
- `backend/common/base_assessment.py` vs `backend/assessments/base/models.py`: Duplicate domain models
- `backend/common/assessment_repository.py` vs `backend/assessments/base/repositories.py`: Duplicate repository interfaces
- `backend/common/assessment_service.py` vs `backend/assessments/base/services.py`: Duplicate service interfaces

**Proposed Solution:**
1. **Consolidate Domain Models**: 
   - Move all domain models to `backend/assessments/base/models.py`
   - Make the models in `base_assessment.py` import from assessments/base
   - Gradually deprecate models in common/ in favor of assessments/base versions

2. **Unify Repository Pattern**:
   - Use repository interfaces from `backend/assessments/base/repositories.py`
   - Implement concrete repositories in assessment-specific modules
   - Remove duplicate interfaces from common directory

3. **Standardize Service Layer**:
   - Consolidate on service interfaces in `backend/assessments/base/services.py`
   - Make all assessment services extend these interfaces
   - Ensure consistent method signatures across implementations

4. **Update Dependencies**:
   - Update import statements in existing modules
   - Add bridge classes for backward compatibility if needed
   - Document new architecture in README files

## Implementation Progress

### Candlestick Pattern Assessment Refactoring

The candlestick pattern assessment implementation has been refactored to properly extend the base assessment architecture. This refactoring addressed several issues:

1. **Consolidated Multiple Implementations**:
   - Replaced the original monolithic implementation in `candlestick_api.py` (1329 lines)
   - Created proper controller in `candlestick_controller.py` extending `BaseAssessmentController`
   - Implemented service in `candlestick_service.py` extending the base `AssessmentService`
   - Created models in `candlestick_models.py` extending the base assessment models

2. **Improved Routing**:
   - Added a `register_routes` function to the module's `__init__.py`
   - Created a compatibility layer for the old API endpoints to redirect to the new implementation
   - Added deprecation warnings to guide developers to the new implementation

3. **Added Testing**:
   - Created a test file for the controller to verify correct operation
   - Implemented mock services for testing
   - Tested integration with the FastAPI application

4. **Documentation**:
   - Created a cleanup plan document for the module
   - Updated the module's README with information on the refactored architecture
   - Added docstrings to all new components

The refactored implementation provides several benefits:
- Better separation of concerns following the MVC pattern
- Improved code reuse through proper inheritance
- Clearer API design and documentation
- Better testability and maintainability

Next steps for this assessment include implementing additional test coverage and enhancing the pattern recognition algorithms.
