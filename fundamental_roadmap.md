ðŸš€ Market Fundamentals Assessment: Full Development Roadmap
After fully completing the Candlestick Pattern Assessment, we now move to Market Fundamentals Assessment. This module tests users on core trading concepts, technical indicators, market structure, and key financial terms. The AI will generate dynamic questions based on real market data.

ðŸ“Œ Phase 1: Planning & Architecture (Research & Setup)
ðŸ”¹ Define Scope & Features
Users will answer multiple-choice and open-ended questions on trading concepts.

AI-generated dynamic questions (No static dataset).

Explanations provided immediately after each answer.

XP, leaderboard, and streak system for engagement.

Adaptive difficulty: AI adjusts question complexity based on user performance.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack Confirmation
âœ… Backend: FastAPI (High-performance APIs)
âœ… Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS (Fast UI, SSR for SEO)
âœ… AI Models: DistilGPT-2 / Mistral 7B (For question generation & explanations)
âœ… Database: PostgreSQL (User data, leaderboard) + MongoDB (AI-generated questions)
âœ… Caching & Realtime: Redis + WebSockets (Fast question generation & live updates)

ðŸ”¹ Directory & Code Structure Setup
Extend backend, frontend, database, and test structure.

Reuse common utilities from Candlestick Assessment.

New module: market_fundamentals

ðŸ“Œ Phase 2: Backend Development (Core Business Logic & AI)
ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Base & Common Utilities
âœ… Reuse base_assessment.py, database.py, cache.py, logger.py, ai_engine.py.
âœ… Extend ai_engine.py to support LLMs (DistilGPT-2, Mistral 7B) for text-based AI processing.

ðŸ”¹ Step 2: AI Model Integration (LLM for Question Generation)
âœ… Implement market_fundamentals_ai.py (Handles AI-generated questions & answers).
âœ… Fine-tune prompts for accurate financial question generation.
âœ… Optimize inference using ONNX Runtime for faster response times.
âœ… Ensure question variations & randomness to prevent repetitive learning.

ðŸ”¹ Step 3: API Development (FastAPI)
âœ… Implement market_fundamentals_api.py (Endpoints for fetching questions, submitting answers, and returning explanations).
âœ… Use WebSockets for real-time updates (Dynamic question generation on the fly).
âœ… Implement market_fundamentals_config.py for all environment settings.

ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Database Models
âœ… Implement market_fundamentals_db.py (Schema for storing questions, attempts, XP, leaderboard).
âœ… AI-generated questions stored in MongoDB.
âœ… User responses, scores, and progress stored in PostgreSQL.

ðŸ“Œ Phase 3: Frontend Development (Next.js UI)
ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Market Fundamentals Quiz UI
âœ… Implement MarketFundamentalsQuiz.jsx (Dynamic quiz interface).
âœ… Implement MarketFundamentalsPage.jsx (Page to host the quiz).
âœ… Integrate API calls (apiClient.js).

ðŸ”¹ Step 6: User Engagement & Real-time Data
âœ… Show real-time generated AI questions.
âœ… Display AI-generated explanations after each response.
âœ… Implement XP, leaderboard, streak tracking on UI.

ðŸ“Œ Phase 4: Testing & Optimization
ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Testing & Quality Assurance
âœ… Write unit tests in test_market_fundamentals.py.
âœ… Validate AI question generation (Ensure relevance & correctness).
âœ… API performance testing (Ensure FastAPI handles concurrent users efficiently).

ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Performance Optimization
âœ… Optimize AI model inference with prompt engineering & response caching.
âœ… Improve UI performance with lazy loading & preloading AI-generated questions.
âœ… Optimize database queries (Indexes, Redis caching).

ðŸ“Œ Phase 5: Deployment & Monitoring
ðŸ”¹ Step 9: Deployment
âœ… Deploy backend API (FastAPI on cloud server, Dockerized).
âœ… Deploy frontend (Next.js on Vercel).
âœ… Deploy database services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis).

ðŸ”¹ Step 10: Monitoring & Analytics
âœ… Set up logging & error tracking.
âœ… Implement performance monitoring (Grafana, Prometheus).
âœ… Track user engagement & optimize AI-generated assessments.

Final Goal ðŸŽ¯
By following this roadmap, we will have a fully functional, AI-driven Market Fundamentals Assessment with real-time AI-generated questions, adaptive difficulty, and leaderboard features. Once this is 100% complete, we will move to the Market Psychology Assessment. ðŸš€
